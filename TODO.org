* TODO =Ambeval= should have a =-ref=, =-fold=, =-map=, =-for-each=.
  An optional =n= which default to =#f=, in which case: go until
  failure.

  Or maybe keep the =ambeval-n= and make an =ambeval-fold=? Can
  implement =map= and =for-each= in terms of fold.
* DONE Multiple modules for e.g. {un,}ordered sets.

    Done up through 3.3.4; TODO: the earlier stuff.
  We’ve already gotten into a situation with e.g. =adjoin-set= that
  we’ve had to create a =huffman-adjoin-set=.

  Huffman also clashes with tree-sets over the definition of
  =left-branch= and =right-branch=, apparently.

  Also makes sense if we want to import some subset of this huge
  thing.
